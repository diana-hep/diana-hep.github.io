In the proposal you should briefly describe the software development activity that you would like to pursue, and how that activity will enhance your own and other people's research activities. Note also the intended software project or person with whom you will collaborate and the location where you would like to travel for that collaboration. The proposal should be short, typically no more than 2-3 paragraphs. Submit your project proposal by email to mike.sokoloff@uc.edu . In 2016, DIANA Fellow positions will be awarded in a rolling fashion based on submitted project proposals. If you are involved in a software project used by the community and have specific projects which could be of interest to potential DIANA Fellows, please send your ideas to mike.sokoloff@uc.edu .They can be listed as example projects in the list below.

The graduate student should have a base stipend from their home institution. The DIANA Fellows program will provides travel and subsistence funds to support direct collaboration with others developing software tools for general use at a second institution. See the Fellow Projects page for example projects of interest and details on how to propose your own project. For more information, contact mike.sokoloff@uc.edu . DIANA Undergraduate Fellow A DIANA Undergraduate Fellow position is also available each year. The student will work 10-12 weeks during the summer, either developing or using data-intensive tools. The DIANA project will provide a stipend for the summer period. For more information on the DIANA Undergraduate Fellow position contact mike.sokoloff@uc.edu . Princeton Princeton University is looking for candidates to work on projects funded as an Intel Parallel Computing Center (IPCC) . This IPCC will work in collaboration with the DIANA project and the ROOT team to modernize aspects of the I/O and Math libraries in ROOT.
