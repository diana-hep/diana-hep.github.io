{"pages":[{"url":"/pages/about.html.html","text":"Advanced software plays a fundamental role in large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. As part of the NSF's Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program, DIANA is concerned with the overarching goal of transforming innovations in research and education into sustained software resources that are an integral part of the cyberinfrastructure.

Nebraska The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is currently searching for a new Software Engineer hire to work on the DIANA project. Within the DIANA project, Nebraska is focusing on improving the performance and interoperability of ROOT I/O. Interested applicants should apply to http://employment.unl.edu/ under requisition S_150926. A summary from the posting's job description (https://employment.unl.edu/postings/47681): The Holland Computing Center (HCC) is a large High Performance Computing facility supporting the NU system. Position will work with other HCC personnel on the DIANA/HEP project which focuses on improving performance, increasing interoperability between HEP software analysis tools and other data-intensive scientific computing ecosystems (such as Apache Spark). Responsibilities include design and implementation of application interfaces; interacting with, using and managing large datasets and solving data-centric problems; organizing, visualizing and communicating digital data effectively. Position serves in both technical and management roles, working closely with technical specialists (e.g. application developers) and with user support (e.g. researchers). Position develops state-of-the-art data analysis tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Criminal background check will be conducted. Excellent benefits including staff/dependent scholarship program. Applicant review begins Feb 8. View requisition S_150926 at https://employment.unl.edu for details and to apply.
